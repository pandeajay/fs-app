1. Build Instructions:
	1.1. Build project using maven
	1.2. Copy and paste neo4j-desktop-2.1.1.jar as not available in maven repo. You can download from Neo4j. here is link https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B9DeM7DxtsOLUFBVVnVIM05CRjg 

2. Project Details:
	2.1. Node has at present one implementation. It follows programming for interfaces principle. Same applies for GraphBuilder and GraphQueryService interfaces. Abstract classes can be option, but in the initial phase of implementation interfaces provide more flexibility. All interfaces follow SOLID design principles.
	2.2. GraphBuilder is used for building and managing graph
	2.3. GraphQueryService is used for querying the graph for shortest path
	2.4. Logger can be replaced with Log4j. At present it is just simple service and focus is on other parts of module.
	2.5. Maven can be used for building project and generating docs. No need to compile from Eclipse.
	2.6. Overall design is flexible through interfaces at many places and using Dependency Injection at almost all places. Spring can be thought at the larger scale application.
	2.7. TDDTest has necessary tests that are important from given application perspective. Each test would test only one functionality at a time.
	2.8. class-dia.jpg shows class diagram.
